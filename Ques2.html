Ques 2- What are data types in Javascript? Explain the different types of data types
         with examples.

   sol- In JavaScript, data types define the kind of values a variable can hold. There are two main categories of data types:

    1)Primitive Data Types (Stores single values, immutable)
    2) Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (Stores complex structures, mutable)

         1. Primitive Data Types
         These are the basic data types that store simple values. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned.
         
       a)String
         A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or backticks (template literals).
         
         EX - 

         let name = "John"; 
         let greeting = 'Hello, World!';
         let message = `Hi, ${name}!`;

       b)Number
         The number data type includes both integers and floating-point numbers.
         
         EX-
         let age = 25; 
         let price = 99.99; 
         let temperature = -5; 

        c) Boolean
         A boolean represents one of two values: true or false. It is commonly used for conditional statements.
         
        EX-
         let isActive = true;
         let isFinished = false;

         d)Undefined
         A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is undefined.
         
         EX-
         let score; 
         console.log(score); 

        e)Null
         The null value represents an intentional absence of any object value.
         
         EX-
         let data = null;
         console.log(data);

         f)Symbol
         A symbol is a unique and immutable primitive data type used to create unique identifiers.
         
         EX-
         let uniqueId = Symbol("id");
         console.log(uniqueId); 

         g)BigInt
         BigInt is used for very large numbers that cannot be represented using the number data type.
         
         EX-
         let bigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740991);
         console.log(bigNumber); 

         2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
             These data types store references to complex values and are mutable.
         
         a)Object
         An object is a collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be of any type.
         
        EX-
         let person = {
             name: "Alice",
             age: 30,
             isActive: true
         };
         console.log(person.name); 

         b)Array
         An array is a type of object that stores multiple values in an ordered list.
         
        EX-
         let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
         let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
         console.log(colors[0]); 
         c)
         Function
         A function is a reusable block of code that can be called multiple times.
         
        EX-
         function greet() {
             console.log("Hello!");
         }
         greet(); // Output: Hello!
